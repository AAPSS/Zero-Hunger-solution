# Zero-Hunger-Solution
## Long Description:
#### The Zero Hunger project, involves solution for farmer’s issues. This project is developed under WIT ACE Hackathon 2021. The project includes IBM Cloud services and focuses on making farmer’s profit. Zero Hunger project is the best platform that involves ideas of problems related to farmers. 
#### The reason behind this project is to solve the major problems faced by farmers. Some of the major problems are :
##  Agricultural Marketing:
Agricultural marketing still continues to be in a bad shape. In the absence of sound marketing facilities, the farmers have to depend upon local traders and middlemen for the disposal of their farm produce which is sold at throw-away price.
## Cropping Pattern: 
The crops that are grown are divided into two broad categories: food crops and non-food crops. In recent years there has occurred a fall in agricultural production mainly due to fall in the output of non-food articles. 
##  Scarcity of capital:
Agriculture is an important industry and like all other industries it also requires capital. The role of capital input is becoming more and more important with the advancement of farm technology. Since the agriculturist’s capital is locked up in his lands and stocks, he is obliged to borrow money for stimulating the tempo of agricultural production.
##  Land Ownership : 
The ownership of agricultural land is fairly widely distributed, there is some degree of concentration of land holding. Inequality in land distribution is also due to the fact that there are frequent changes in land ownership.
## The systems and techniques of farming
## Inadequate water supply

#### We have developed this project for agricultural marketing using modern techniques. The project involves two sides one of user i.e. farmer and the other of admin from IBM. 
## The page comprehend:
### SignUp  / LogIn :
 Under signup, it asks for details of user and identity proof. After signing in, user can login in the same page with credentials. After Login the page directs to dashboard. Admin will have direct access.
### Dashboard : 
Under user side it shows profile, can update profile, also shows user’s production ad profit. Under admin side, it shows farmer’s request from application, requirements of farmers in map and verify farmer’s request.

## Idea behind the project : 
The food co-ops will be excluded from the entire procedure of selling and buying. A farmer would update his information about crops and yield. From the site a normal user can approach the farmer directly looking at the convenient location and required raw food items. This will directly connect farmer to the purchaser without approaching a mediator. This will cut down the extra cost of transport for farmer and farmer can sell his products at his own price without any loss. This ultimately, reduces the cost of products for a normal user too and the farmer can be benefitted with the direct approach. 

## Technology that can be used: 
#### IBM DB2 for managing data, 
#### IBM Watson Translator to make it easier to read for all,
#### Domain Name Services for deployment of application,
